    content: "\n            You are solving a Github issue in the repository .\n            You must make the changes to solve,\
        \ close, or address the issue, directly in the code.\n            Allow FilePathField path to accept a callable.\n\
        Description\n\t\nI have a special case where I want to create a model containing the path to some local files on the\
        \ server/dev machine. Seeing as the place where these files are stored is different on different machines I have the\
        \ following:\nimport os\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\nclass LocalFiles(models.Model):\n\
        \tname = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n\tfile = models.FilePathField(path=os.path.join(settings.LOCAL_FILE_DIR,\
        \ 'example_dir'))\nNow when running manage.py makemigrations it will resolve the path based on the machine it is being\
        \ run on. Eg: /home/<username>/server_files/example_dir\nI had to manually change the migration to include the os.path.join()\
        \ part to not break this when running the migration on production/other machine.\n"
