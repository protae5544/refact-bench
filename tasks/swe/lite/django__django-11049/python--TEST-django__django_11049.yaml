        \ close, or address the issue, directly in the code.\n            Correct expected format in invalid DurationField\
        \ error message\nDescription\n\t\nIf you enter a duration \"14:00\" into a duration field, it translates to \"00:14:00\"\
        \ which is 14 minutes.\nThe current error message for invalid DurationField says that this should be the format of\
        \ durations: \"[DD] [HH:[MM:]]ss[.uuuuuu]\". But according to the actual behaviour, it should be: \"[DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu]\"\
        , because seconds are mandatory, minutes are optional, and hours are optional if minutes are provided.\nThis seems\
        \ to be a mistake in all Django versions that support the DurationField.\nAlso the duration fields could have a default\
        \ help_text with the requested format, because the syntax is not self-explanatory.\n"
