        \ for models recreated as a proxy.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Mariusz Felisiak)\n\t \nI am trying to\
        \ update my project to Django 2.2. When I launch python manage.py migrate, I get this error message when migration\
        \ auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions is applying (full stacktrace is available ​here):\ndjango.db.utils.IntegrityError:\
        \ duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"idx_18141_auth_permission_content_type_id_01ab375a_uniq\" DETAIL:\
        \ Key (co.ntent_type_id, codename)=(12, add_agency) already exists.\nIt looks like the migration is trying to re-create\
        \ already existing entries in the auth_permission table. At first I though it cloud because we recently renamed a\
        \ model. But after digging and deleting the entries associated with the renamed model from our database in the auth_permission\
        \ table, the problem still occurs with other proxy models.\nI tried to update directly from 2.0.13 and 2.1.8. The\
        \ issues appeared each time. I also deleted my venv and recreated it without an effect.\nI searched for a ticket about\
        \ this on the bug tracker but found nothing. I also posted this on ​django-users and was asked to report this here.\n"
