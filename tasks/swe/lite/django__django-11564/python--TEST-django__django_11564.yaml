    content: "\n            You are solving a Github issue in the repository .\n            You must make the changes to solve,\
        \ close, or address the issue, directly in the code.\n            Add support for SCRIPT_NAME in STATIC_URL and MEDIA_URL\n\
        Description\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Rostyslav Bryzgunov)\n\t \nBy default, {% static '...' %} tag just appends\
        \ STATIC_URL in the path. When running on sub-path, using SCRIPT_NAME WSGI param, it results in incorrect static URL\
        \ - it doesn't prepend SCRIPT_NAME prefix.\nThis problem can be solved with prepending SCRIPT_NAME to STATIC_URL in\
        \ settings.py but that doesn't work when SCRIPT_NAME is a dynamic value.\nThis can be easily added into default Django\
        \ static tag and django.contrib.staticfiles tag as following:\ndef render(self, context):\n\turl = self.url(context)\n\
        \t# Updating url here with request.META['SCRIPT_NAME'] \n\tif self.varname is None:\n\t\treturn url\n\tcontext[self.varname]\
        \ = url\n\t\treturn ''\nOn more research I found that FileSystemStorage and StaticFilesStorage ignores SCRIPT_NAME\
        \ as well. \nWe might have to do a lot of changes but I think it's worth the efforts.\n"
