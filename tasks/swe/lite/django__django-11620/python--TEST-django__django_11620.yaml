        \ close, or address the issue, directly in the code.\n            When DEBUG is True, raising Http404 in a path converter's\
        \ to_python method does not result in a technical response\nDescription\n\t\nThis is the response I get (plain text):\
        \ \nA server error occurred. Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells\
        \ the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and\
        \ the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way\
        \ to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so\
        \ stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is\
        \ True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement\
        \ a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
