        Description\n\t\nThere is currently no check to ensure that Field.max_length is large enough to fit the longest value\
        \ in Field.choices.\nThis would be very helpful as often this mistake is not noticed until an attempt is made to save\
        \ a record with those values that are too long.\n"
