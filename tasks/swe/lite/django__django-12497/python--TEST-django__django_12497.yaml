        \t \n\t\t(last modified by Matheus Cunha Motta)\n\t \nWhen there's more than 2 ForeignKeys in an intermediary model\
        \ of a m2m field and no through_fields have been set, Django will show an error with the following hint:\nhint=(\n\
        \t'If you want to create a recursive relationship, '\n\t'use ForeignKey(\"%s\", symmetrical=False, through=\"%s\"\
        ).'\nBut 'symmetrical' and 'through' are m2m keyword arguments, not ForeignKey.\nThis was probably a small mistake\
        \ where the developer thought ManyToManyField but typed ForeignKey instead. And the symmetrical=False is an outdated\
        \ requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR\
        \ with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
