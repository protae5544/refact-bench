        \ close, or address the issue, directly in the code.\n            QuerySet.Delete - inconsistent result when zero\
        \ objects deleted\nDescription\n\t\nThe result format of the QuerySet.Delete method is a tuple: (X, Y) \nX - is the\
        \ total amount of deleted objects (including foreign key deleted objects)\nY - is a dictionary specifying counters\
        \ of deleted objects for each specific model (the key is the _meta.label of the model and the value is counter of\
        \ deleted objects of this model).\nExample: <class 'tuple'>: (2, {'my_app.FileAccess': 1, 'my_app.File': 1})\nWhen\
        \ there are zero objects to delete in total - the result is inconsistent:\nFor models with foreign keys - the result\
        \ will be: <class 'tuple'>: (0, {})\nFor \"simple\" models without foreign key - the result will be: <class 'tuple'>:\
        \ (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0})\nI would expect there will be no difference between the two cases: Either both will\
        \ have the empty dictionary OR both will have dictionary with model-label keys and zero value.\n"
