        \t \n\t\t(last modified by Raffaele Salmaso)\n\t \nI need to manipulate the app_list in my custom admin view, and\
        \ the easiest way to get the result is to have access to the model class (currently the dictionary is a serialized\
        \ model).\nIn addition I would make the _build_app_dict method public, as it is used by the two views index and app_index.\n"
