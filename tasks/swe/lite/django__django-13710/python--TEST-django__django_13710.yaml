    content: "\n            You are solving a Github issue in the repository .\n            You must make the changes to solve,\
        \ close, or address the issue, directly in the code.\n            Use Admin Inline verbose_name as default for Inline\
        \ verbose_name_plural\nDescription\n\t\nDjango allows specification of a verbose_name and a verbose_name_plural for\
        \ Inline classes in admin views. However, verbose_name_plural for an Inline is not currently based on a specified\
        \ verbose_name. Instead, it continues to be based on the model name, or an a verbose_name specified in the model's\
        \ Meta class. This was confusing to me initially (I didn't understand why I had to specify both name forms for an\
        \ Inline if I wanted to overrule the default name), and seems inconsistent with the approach for a model's Meta class\
        \ (which does automatically base the plural form on a specified verbose_name). I propose that verbose_name_plural\
        \ for an Inline class should by default be based on the verbose_name for an Inline if that is specified.\nI have written\
        \ a patch to implement this, including tests. Would be happy to submit that.\n"
