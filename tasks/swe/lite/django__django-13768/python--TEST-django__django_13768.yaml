        \ close, or address the issue, directly in the code.\n            Log exceptions handled in Signal.send_robust()\n\
        Description\n\t\nAs pointed out by â€‹Haki Benita on Twitter, by default Signal.send_robust() doesn't have any log messages\
        \ for exceptions raised in receivers. Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template\
        \ variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users\
        \ would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action\
        \ to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n"
