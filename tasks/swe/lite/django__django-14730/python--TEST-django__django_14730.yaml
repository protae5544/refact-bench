        \ close, or address the issue, directly in the code.\n            Prevent developers from defining a related_name\
        \ on symmetrical ManyToManyFields\nDescription\n\t\nIn ManyToManyField, if the symmetrical argument is passed, or\
        \ if it's a self-referential ManyToMany relationship, the related field on the target model is not created. However,\
        \ if a developer passes in the related_name not understanding this fact, they may be confused until they find the\
        \ information about symmetrical relationship. Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField\
        \ in this condition.\n"
