        \ close, or address the issue, directly in the code.\n            Dev Server fails to restart after adding BASE_DIR\
        \ to TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS'] in settings\nDescription\n\t\nRepro steps:\n$ pip install -U django\n$ django-admin startproject\
        \ <name>\nOpen settings.py, copy the BASE_DIR variable from line 16 and paste it into the empty DIRS list on line\
        \ 57\n$ ./manage.py runserver\nBack in your IDE, save a file and watch the dev server *NOT* restart.\nBack in settings.py,\
        \ remove BASE_DIR from the templates DIRS list. Manually CTRL-C your dev server (as it won't restart on its own when\
        \ you save), restart the dev server. Now return to your settings.py file, re-save it, and notice the development server\
        \ once again detects changes and restarts.\nThis bug prevents the dev server from restarting no matter where you make\
        \ changes - it is not just scoped to edits to settings.py.\n"
