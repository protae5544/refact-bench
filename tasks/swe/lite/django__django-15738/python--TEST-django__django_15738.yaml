        \ and deleting unique together.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Simon Charette)\n\t \nI have models like\n\
        class Authors(models.Model):\n\tproject_data_set = models.ForeignKey(\n\t\tProjectDataSet,\n\t\ton_delete=models.PROTECT\n\
        \t)\n\tstate = models.IntegerField()\n\tstart_date = models.DateField()\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\t unique_together = (('project_data_set',\
        \ 'state', 'start_date'),)\nand\nclass DataSet(models.Model):\n\tname = models.TextField(max_length=50)\nclass Project(models.Model):\n\
        \tdata_sets = models.ManyToManyField(\n\t\tDataSet,\n\t\tthrough='ProjectDataSet',\n\t)\n\tname = models.TextField(max_length=50)\n\
        class ProjectDataSet(models.Model):\n\t\"\"\"\n\tCross table of data set and project\n\t\"\"\"\n\tdata_set = models.ForeignKey(DataSet,\
        \ on_delete=models.PROTECT)\n\tproject = models.ForeignKey(Project, on_delete=models.PROTECT)\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\t\
        unique_together = (('data_set', 'project'),)\nwhen i want to change field project_data_set in Authors model from foreign\
        \ key field to many to many field I must delete a unique_together, cause it can't be on many to many field.\nThen\
        \ my model should be like:\nclass Authors(models.Model):\n\tproject_data_set = models.ManyToManyField(\n\t\tProjectDataSet,\n\
        \t)\n\tstate = models.IntegerField()\n\tstart_date = models.DateField()\nBut when I want to do a migrations.\npython3\
        \ manage.py makemigrations\npython3 manage.py migrate\nI have error:\nValueError: Found wrong number (0) of constraints\
        \ for app_authors(project_data_set, state, start_date)\nThe database is on production, so I can't delete previous\
        \ initial migrations, and this error isn't depending on database, cause I delete it and error is still the same.\n\
        My solve is to first delete unique_together, then do a makemigrations and then migrate. After that change the field\
        \ from foreign key to many to many field, then do a makemigrations and then migrate.\nBut in this way I have 2 migrations\
        \ instead of one.\nI added attachment with this project, download it and then do makemigrations and then migrate to\
        \ see this error.\n"
