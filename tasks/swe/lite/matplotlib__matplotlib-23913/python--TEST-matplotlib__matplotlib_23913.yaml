        \ at creation**\r\n\r\n<!--A short 1-2 sentences that succinctly describes the bug-->\r\n\r\nIs there a code reason\
        \ why one can not add a \"draggable=True\" keyword to the __init__ function for Legend?  This would be more handy\
        \ than having to call it after legend creation.  And, naively, it would seem simple to do.  But maybe there is a reason\
        \ why it would not work?\n"
