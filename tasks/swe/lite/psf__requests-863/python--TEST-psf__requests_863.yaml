    content: "\n            You are solving a Github issue in the repository .\n            You must make the changes to solve,\
        \ close, or address the issue, directly in the code.\n            Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\n\
        Currently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks\
        \ argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions\
        \ per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed\
        \ (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.\
        \  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook()\
        \ multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the\
        \ hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
