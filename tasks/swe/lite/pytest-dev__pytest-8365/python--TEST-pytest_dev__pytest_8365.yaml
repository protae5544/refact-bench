    content: "\n            You are solving a Github issue in the repository .\n            You must make the changes to solve,\
        \ close, or address the issue, directly in the code.\n            tmpdir creation fails when the username contains\
        \ illegal characters for directory names\n`tmpdir`, `tmpdir_factory` and `tmp_path_factory` rely on `getpass.getuser()`\
        \ for determining the `basetemp` directory. I found that the user name returned by `getpass.getuser()` may return\
        \ characters that are not allowed for directory names. This may lead to errors while creating the temporary directory.\r\
        \n\r\nThe situation in which I reproduced this issue was while being logged in through an ssh connection into my Windows\
        \ 10 x64 Enterprise version (1909) using an OpenSSH_for_Windows_7.7p1 server. In this configuration the command `python\
        \ -c \"import getpass; print(getpass.getuser())\"` returns my domain username e.g. `contoso\\john_doe` instead of\
        \ `john_doe` as when logged in regularly using a local session.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to create a temp directory in pytest\
        \ through e.g. `tmpdir_factory.mktemp('foobar')` this fails with the following error message:\r\n```\r\nself = WindowsPath('C:/Users/john_doe/AppData/Local/Temp/pytest-of-contoso/john_doe')\r\
        \nmode = 511, parents = False, exist_ok = True\r\n\r\n    def mkdir(self, mode=0o777, parents=False, exist_ok=False):\r\
        \n        \"\"\"\r\n        Create a new directory at this given path.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        if self._closed:\r\
        \n            self._raise_closed()\r\n        try:\r\n>           self._accessor.mkdir(self, mode)\r\nE          \
        \ FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\john_doe\\\\AppData\\\
        \\Local\\\\Temp\\\\pytest-of-contoso\\\\john_doe'\r\n\r\nC:\\Python38\\lib\\pathlib.py:1266: FileNotFoundError\r\n\
        ```\r\n\r\nI could also reproduce this without the complicated ssh/windows setup with pytest 6.2.2 using the following\
        \ commands from a `cmd`:\r\n```bat\r\necho def test_tmpdir(tmpdir):>test_tmp.py\r\necho   pass>>test_tmp.py\r\nset\
        \ LOGNAME=contoso\\john_doe\r\npy.test test_tmp.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks for having a look at this!\n"
