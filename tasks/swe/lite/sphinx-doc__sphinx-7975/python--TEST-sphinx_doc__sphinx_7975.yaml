        \ close, or address the issue, directly in the code.\n            Two sections called Symbols in index\nWhen using\
        \ index entries with the following leading characters: _@_, _£_, and _←_ I get two sections called _Symbols_ in the\
        \ HTML output, the first containing all _@_ entries before ”normal” words and the second containing _£_ and _←_ entries\
        \ after the ”normal” words.  Both have the same anchor in HTML so the links at the top of the index page contain two\
        \ _Symbols_ links, one before the letters and one after, but both lead to the first section.\n\n"
