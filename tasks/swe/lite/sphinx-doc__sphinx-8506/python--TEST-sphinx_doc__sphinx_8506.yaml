        \ without complaint.\r\n\r\nThe QEMU documentation includes this:\r\n```\r\n.. option:: [enable=]PATTERN\r\n\r\n \
        \  Immediately enable events matching *PATTERN*\r\n```\r\n\r\nas part of the documentation of the command line options\
        \ of one of its programs. Earlier versions of Sphinx were fine with this, but Sphinx 3.2 complains:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\
        Warning, treated as error:\r\n../../docs/qemu-option-trace.rst.inc:4:Malformed option description '[enable=]PATTERN',\
        \ should look like \"opt\", \"-opt args\", \"--opt args\", \"/opt args\" or \"+opt args\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSphinx ideally\
        \ shouldn't change in ways that break the building of documentation that worked in older versions, because this makes\
        \ it unworkably difficult to have documentation that builds with whatever the Linux distro's sphinx-build is.\r\n\r\
        \nThe error message suggests that Sphinx has a very restrictive idea of what option syntax is; it would be better\
        \ if it just accepted any string, because not all programs and OSes have option syntax that matches the limited list\
        \ the error message indicates.\r\n\n"
