        \ close, or address the issue, directly in the code.\n            decompose() function in intpoly returns a list of\
        \ arbitrary order\nThe decompose() function, with separate=True, returns `list(poly_dict.values())`, which is ordered\
        \ arbitrarily.  \r\n\r\nWhat is this used for? It should be sorted somehow, or returning a set (in which case, why\
        \ not just use the returned dictionary and have the caller take the values). This is causing test failures for me\
        \ after some changes to the core. \r\n\r\nCC @ArifAhmed1995 @certik \n"
