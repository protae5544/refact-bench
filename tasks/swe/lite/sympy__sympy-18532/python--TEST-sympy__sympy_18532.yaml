        \ close, or address the issue, directly in the code.\n            expr.atoms() should return objects with no args\
        \ instead of subclasses of Atom\n`expr.atoms()` with no arguments returns subclasses of `Atom` in `expr`. But the\
        \ correct definition of a leaf node should be that it has no `.args`. \n\nThis should be easy to fix, but one needs\
        \ to check that this doesn't affect the performance. \n\n"
